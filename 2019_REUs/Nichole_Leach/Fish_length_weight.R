# if max lenght is 32 cm according to FishBase?

# Plot frequency distribution  (histogram) of Standard lenght, using 32 bins
# 32 bc I want bins to be 1 cm and the max lenght is 40

# you can achieve the same plot by specifying the with of bins. In this case = 1 cm

# Is there a correlation between weight and length?
