# PIRE REU README

***Congratulations on being accepted as a PIRE REU!!!***

This README will serve as a guide for your entire REU experience. Please check this document continuously for updates. You can always contact your mentors for questions as well.

**Overview**

During the REU experience, you will be performing independent original research and will be responsible for:

1. Presenting a project proposal
2. Writing a manuscript for your project
3. Presenting your final results

Please pay attention to the schedule below to guide your work and complete the required weekly items (deliverables). You will be assigned a graduate student mentor (GSM) to help you with all aspects of your project. Please, do not hesitate to ask questions!!

*REUs with bioinformatic projects will first process 1 species through the [PIRE SSL pipeline](https://github.com/philippinespire/pire_ssl_data_processing) pipeline.
Then, they will perform PSMC demographic analyses of their species, along with other species that have already been processed through the SSL pipeline, to assess whether life history traits can be associated with population historical trends.

The list of potential species that can be used to test the effect of life history traits on demographic inference 
 can be found in the [Species properties for PSMC study](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tqMv7CpAdvsZi8Izi8mZp5efSnAsTzIuZDRS1KeV9Bk/edit#gid=0) sheet.

Mentors can help you if you're not already familiar with reference databases. You will then use these references to write  an introduction for your report (a minimum of 1 page but can be longer). The introduction should lay out the relevant literature and justification for your work and include a concise statement of the research goals (this will be due at the end of next week). |Complete Citation Database        |

## Outline for the Presentation of your Proposal

Your presentation should be 5 min long, and then you will receive feedback from the audience during the subsequent 10-15 min.

Your presentation should include:
* Introduction (1-2 min)
* Methods (1-2 min)
* Hypotheses (1-2 min)

As the speaker, you should spend about the same time in each of the main sections but you do have some flexibility on this.

You can watch the proposals of previous REUs [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZqfAgUd0hkidPRuZ5oPVx5CtDV6xi3Vv). This might take a while to load, be patient. Also please skip to the 55 min marker as the beginning of this recording is blank. We recommend watching this BEFORE you leave the US in case there are streaming problems in the Philippines.

---

## Outline for Final Presentation

Your presentation should be 12 min and then the audience will get a chance to ask questions.

Your presentation should include:
* Introduction with goals and hypotheses to be tested (2-3 min)
* Methods (2-3 min)
* Results (2-3 min)
* Discussion (2-3 min)
* Conclusion (~1 min)
