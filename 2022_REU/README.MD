## Projects and Graduate Student Mentors (GSM)

|REU | Institution | Project | SSL species | GSM |

|Abbigail Ethridge* | ODU | Effect of habitat usage on demography inference in Philippine fishes | Stethojulis interrupta | George |
|Eryka Molino* | ASU | Effect of species distribution on demography inference in Philippine fishes | Ostorhinchus chrysopomus | Roy |
|Rebecca Ruiz | TAMUCC | Decadal changes in reef-fish species composition | None | John? | 
|Allison Fink* | Rutgers | Effect of reproductive strategy on demography inference  in Philippine fishes | Corythoichthys haematopterus | Jordan |
|Marial Malabag | Rutgers | Effect of life history traits on marine genetic diversity | none | Rene |

*REUs with bioinformatic projects will first process 1 species through the [PIRE SSL pipeline](https://github.com/philippinespire/pire_ssl_data_processing) pipeline.
Then perform PSMC demographic analyses of their species, along with other species that have already been processed through the SSL pipeline, to assess whether life history traits can be associated with population histories.

The List of potential species to test the effect of life history traits on demographic inference 
 can be found in the [Species properties for PSMC study](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tqMv7CpAdvsZi8Izi8mZp5efSnAsTzIuZDRS1KeV9Bk/edit#gid=0) sheet.

|Philippines|27-Jun        |3   |Organize a literature cited page (at least 10 primary literature papers) into a properly formatted database (EndNote, Mendeley, etc).  Mentors can help you if you're not already familiar with reference databases. You will then use these references to write  a <250 word abstract and an introduction for your report (a minimum of 1 page but can be longer).  The introduction should lay out relevant literature and justification for your work and include a concise statement of the research goals |Citation Database,  Abstract and Introduction         |
