List of potential species to test the effect of life history traits on demographic inference can be found in the [Species properties for PSMC study](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tqMv7CpAdvsZi8Izi8mZp5efSnAsTzIuZDRS1KeV9Bk/edit#gid=0) sheet.


REUs will process 1 species through the [pire_ssl](https://github.com/philippinespire/pire_ssl_data_processing) pipeline and will be coupled with a grad student as follows:

|REU | Institution | Project | SSL species | Mentor |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Abbigail Ethridge | ODU | Effect of habitat usage on demography inference in Philippine fishes | Stethojulis interrupta | Jem |
|Eryka Molino | ASU | Effect of species distribution on demography inference in Philippine fishes | Ostorhinchus chrysopomus | Roy |
|Rebecca Ruiz | TAMUCC | Decadal changes in reef-fish species composition | None | John | 
|Allison Fink | Rutgers | Effect of reproductive strategy on demography inference  in Philippine fishes | Corythoichthys haematopterus | Jordan |
|Marial Malabag | Rutgers | Effect of life history traits on marine genetic diversity | none | Rene |$
