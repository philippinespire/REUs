List of potential species to test the effect of life history traits on demographic inferance can be found in the [Species properties for PSMC study](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tqMv7CpAdvsZi8Izi8mZp5efSnAsTzIuZDRS1KeV9Bk/edit#gid=0) sheet.


REUs will process 1 species through the [pire_ssl](https://github.com/philippinespire/pire_ssl_data_processing) pipeline and will be coupled with a grad student as follows:

|REU  | Institution  | Project | SSL species | Mentor |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | 
|Abbigail Ethridge | ODU | Effect of habihat usage on demography inference | Stethojulis interrupta | Jem |
