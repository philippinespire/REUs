# PIRE REU README

***Congratulations on being accepted as a PIRE REU!!!***

This README will serve as a guide for your entire REU experience. Please check this document continuously for updates. You can always contact your mentors for questions as well.

**Overview**

During the REU experience, you will be performing independent original research and will be responsible for:

1. Presenting a project proposal
2. Writing a manuscript for your project
3. Presenting your final results

Please pay attention to the schedule below to guide your work and complete the required weekly items (deliverables). You will be assigned a graduate student mentor (GSM) to help you with all aspects of your project. Please, do not hesitate to ask questions!!

*REUs with bioinformatic projects will first process 1 species through the [PIRE SSL pipeline](https://github.com/philippinespire/pire_ssl_data_processing) pipeline.
Then, they will perform PSMC demographic analyses of their species, along with other species that have already been processed through the SSL pipeline, to assess whether life history traits can be associated with population historical trends.

The list of potential species that can be used to test the effect of life history traits on demographic inference 
 can be found in the [Species properties for PSMC study](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tqMv7CpAdvsZi8Izi8mZp5efSnAsTzIuZDRS1KeV9Bk/edit#gid=0) sheet.

## Outline for the Presentation of your Proposal

Your presentation should be 5 min long, and then you will receive feedback from the audience during the subsequent 10-15 min.

Your presentation should include:
* Introduction (1-2 min)
* Methods (1-2 min)
* Hypotheses (1-2 min)

As the speaker, you should spend about the same time in each of the main sections but you do have some flexibility on this.

You can watch the proposals of previous REUs [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZqfAgUd0hkidPRuZ5oPVx5CtDV6xi3Vv). This might take a while to load, be patient. Also please skip to the 55 min marker as the beginning of this recording is blank. We recommend watching this BEFORE you leave the US in case there are streaming problems in the Philippines.

---

## Outline for Final Presentation

Your presentation should be 12 min and then the audience will get a chance to ask questions.

Your presentation should include:
* Introduction with goals and hypotheses to be tested (2-3 min)
* Methods (2-3 min)
* Results (2-3 min)
* Discussion (2-3 min)
* Conclusion (~1 min)

## Bioinformatic projects

The first main goal is to have each student process 1 species through the SSL pipeline and generate a genome assembly for that species. 
 The second main goal of all 3 projects is to determine if a relationship between demographic history and life history traits exit. 
 Abigail, Eryka and Allison will be investigating, preferred habitat, distribution, and egg type, respectively, as their specific life history traits.  

Using the [Species properties for PSMC study](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tqMv7CpAdvsZi8Izi8mZp5efSnAsTzIuZDRS1KeV9Bk/edit#gid=0) sheet students should begin their projects by  assigning species into different groups within their life history trait of interest so that they can later test for differences between these groups.

That is, each student should be populating the following tables below in preparation for their proposal: 

**Abigail**
|Habitat | Species | 
| --- |  --- |
| Reef | at least 4 species here |
| Coastal/semi-pelagics | at least 4 species here |
| Estuary/brackish water | at least 4 species here |

**Eryka**
|Distribution | Species |  
| --- |  --- |
| West Pacific | at least 4 species here |
| Indo-West Pacific (Africa to West Pacific) | at least 4 species here |
| Indo-West Pacific (India to West Pacific) | how many species? |

**Here, Eryka can decide whether or not to include the third group depending if she can classify species there 

**Allison**
|Egg type | Species |  
| --- |  --- |
| Demersal eggs | at least 4 species here |
| Mouth/tail brooders | at least 4 species here |

Each student should review the biology of all the species (by reading the literature and using the links provided in the "Resource" section above) to confirm their group assignations. If a species cannot be confidently assigned into a group, then that species can be dismissed from a specific study. At the very least each student should have 2 groups with 4 species, but more species will bring more confidence when answering the questions. 

After confirming their groups, students can use PSMC to estimate the population history of their species and test whether variables from the PSMC output such as the maximum, minimum or average Ne (Ne=effective population size), differ between the groups of species. While, this is happening only after the second workshop, students can present their plans in their proposal

In their proposals:
* Introduction (1-2 min)

Students can identify a lack of knowledge (might be that there are no studies associating demographic history and life history trait in Philippine fishes) and why this topic is important (by reading about the importance of Ne for example, or how understanding population past in the light of biological traits can help predict changes in the future, etc)
and introduce your groups of species

* Methods (1-2 min)

Give a short mention of the SSL (i.e. generating genome assemblies for species) and PSMC (generating the population history of a species) methodology. More specifically, each student  will generate the genome assembly for one species but use PSMC in all of the species in their groups to answer their specific questions/hypotheses
 (the SSL will be done for the rest of the species) (the second workshop will teach students the SSL and PMSC pipelines).

* Hypotheses (1-2 min)
Students should identify question(s)/hypotheses (for example, null hypothesis= no difference between groups, alternate hypothesis= there will be a difference) and provide predictions if any
