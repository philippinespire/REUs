** Renamed the files, started pre-processing data. Submitted jobs for MultiFastQC and the first trim. Waiting for output. Had a difficult time pulling and pushing into git. 

*July 12, 2022:
** MultiFastQC job was completed, but the Fastp first trim job had failed. Started rerunning that script. Could not yet fill out the README to update with percent duplication, numnber of reads/scaffoled/short reads, etc because git push and pull has not yet been figured out. Waiting for fastp job to finish. WAiting for git push and pull so I can review my MultiFastQC report. Finished editing my introduction after a passthrough with Eric and John. Plan to finish Pre-processing today and start genome assembly.
